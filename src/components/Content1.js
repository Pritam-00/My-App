                internet in your leisure time and found 
                a beautiful photo of a big snow field, 
                and you decided for youself that is the place you want
                to be this holiday, enough of hustle, it's time for adventure. 
                 You hurridly booked
                the trek, you have one previous experience
                of a hike you did with your friends a long
                time ago. You reached your base camp,
                started the trek, suddenly you find yourself
                struggling, you are out of shape, you have been 
                doing desk jobs for last couple of years and have
                been out for holidays a few times. You can 
                not go back now cause you have saved up money 
                for this and you have taken your precious leave. 
                After 3days you reach an intermediate diffcult 
                day, today we have a 2000ft climb, but you don't 
                feel confident, doubts fill your mind, would

                How To Understand Difficulty Level of a Trek ?
            </h4>
            <p className="p-2"> Difficulty comes in all forms, 
                extensive long walking days, long duration 
                of the treks, high gradients or simply the route 
                is in high windy valley or, may be in rainshadow 
                region for which it sees frequent rainfall. 
                <br></br> <br></br>
                We have marked all our treks between 0 and 5 
                according to Difficulty, by a method  which carefully 
                takes in account all the difficulties that can be 
                faced by a trekker and finally realistically 
                comparing them to treks which have scores lower and higher. 
                <br></br><br></br>
                The understanding of difficulty happens when you 
                have overall knowledge of the route, conversation with 
                real people who have been to the trek in combination with 
                real photo-videos and maps.
                <br></br><br></br>
                Here are some points which you can take in account, while 
                understanding difficulty of routes: </p>
