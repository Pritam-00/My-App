          A Short Yet Adventurous Trek At The Backyard Of Manali
        </h2>
        <p className="pb-5">
          We found this place on a local gossip and as we continued our research
          we found the place somehow loosely connected to Bengal and Alexander.
          The Trail to ranisui is the first part of this bigger route which
          takes you from Kullu valley to Dharmshala and we will focus on that
          part i.e. the trek to Ranisui.
        </p>

        <p>Ranisui is a small alpine lake at
          around 12,400ft. Even though the trek is called Ranisui Lake Trek, the
          lake never came up as the main attraction, the Khanpari Tibba took all
          the glory. The 360 degree view from Khanpari Tibba is a part that
          matches that of heaven. In every corner there is a white peak.
          Indrasan, Deo Tibba, Inderkillla... friendship, Mulkila, Kulkangari
          and many more. There are 100 others which are still unnamed and
          unclimbed(hope some of you venture them). <b className="font-semibold">The pleasant wind, clear
          azure blue sky, blanket of green grass here at the top, reminds us of
          our childhood, as we slowly lay down and somehow brings us close to
          what we really are and to the earth.</b>
